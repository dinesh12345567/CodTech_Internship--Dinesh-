# CodTech Internship â€“ Dinesh (Data Science Task)

This repository contains the deliverables for the internship at CodTech, where I successfully completed four hands-on tasks focused on real-world applications of data science, machine learning, and optimization. Each task showcases the practical use of Python libraries and frameworks to solve different classes of problems in the data science workflow.

TASK 1 : Data Pipeline Development

Objective: Create a pipeline for data preprocessing, transformation, and loading using Pandas and Scikit-learn.

Highlights: Cleaned and handled missing data. Applied feature scaling and encoding. Built a reusable pipeline using Pipeline and ColumnTransformer from sklearn. Automated the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

TASK 2 : Deep Learning for Image Classification / NLP

Objective: Implement a deep learning model for image classification or natural language processing using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Highlights: Built and trained a CNN using TensorFlow for image classification (or NLP using RNNs if applicable). Visualized training accuracy, loss, and predictions. Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix and metrics.

TASK 3 : Full Data Science Project with Deployment

Objective: Develop an end-to-end data science project from data collection and model building to deployment using Flask or FastAPI.

Highlights: Performed EDA, feature engineering, and trained a regression/classification model. Deployed the model using Flask to create a user-friendly web interface. Included input form and live predictions.

TASK 4 : Business Optimization Using Linear Programming

Objective: Solve a real-world business optimization problem using linear programming with Python's PuLP library.

Highlights: Modeled the business constraints and objective function. Solved using pulp.LpProblem and LpSolver. Interpreted optimal resource allocation and business insights.

TECHNOLOGIES USED Languages: Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PuLP Frameworks: Flask Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio, Git, GitHub
